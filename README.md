# Prediction of Protein Properties
Welcome to the repository for my Masterâ€™s thesis! This repository contains all the code and data used in my thesis work. This repository is still work in progress !

The thesis focuses on the prediction of three key protein properties: O/N glycosylation, B-factor, and relative surface accessibility. Specifically, it explores the potential of protein Language Model (pLM) embedding-based predictors in these areas.

### Dependencies
To set up the project, you can either:

- Use pixi: To install Pixi simply execute the following: `curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash`. For more information about shell integration, please refere to the [documentation](https://pixi.sh/dev/#autocompletion). After ensuring that pixi is installed on your system, run `pixi install` from within the root directory of the repository. This will create a `.pixi` directory which will contain all the dependencies. To remove the dependencies just delete the `.pixi` folder and optionally run `pixi clean cache`
  
  ```
  curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
  pixi install
  ```
- Use Conda: If you prefer not to use pixi, you can alternatively install the dependencies via Conda: `conda env create -f environment.yml`. The new enviroment can be activated using `conda activate prot_prop`
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate prot_prop
  ```
### Get data
- The tsv and fasta files can be optained by downloading the provided zip file and extracting it within the root directory of this repository: `wget -i data/data_download.txt && unzip data.zip`
- Afterwards the embeddings can be generated ... (note this requires a fairly large GPU with a minumum of 12GB of VRAM)


### TODO
- [x] transition from poetry to pixi and conda requirments file 
- [x] automate data download -> maybe use pixi task
- [ ] automate embeddings creation (for train and test time)
- [ ] add prediction script/notebook
- [ ] finish README.md
