# Prediction of Protein Properties
Welcome to the repository for my Masterâ€™s thesis! This repository contains all the code and data used in my thesis work. This repository is still work in progress !

The thesis focuses on the prediction of three key protein properties: O/N glycosylation, B-factor, and relative surface accessibility. Specifically, it explores the potential of protein Language Model (pLM) embedding-based predictors in these areas.

### Dependencies
To set up the project, you can either:

- Use pixi: Ensure that pixi is installed on your system and run `pixi install` from within the root directory of the repository. This will create a `.pixi` directory which will contain all the dependencies. To remove the dependencies just delete the `.pixi` folder and optionally run `pixi clean cache` 
- Use Conda: If you prefer not to use pixi, you can alternatively install the dependencies via Conda


### TODO
- [ ] transition from poetry to pixi and conda requirments file 
- [ ] automate data download
- [ ] automate embeddings creation (for train and test time)
- [ ] add prediction script/notebook
- [ ] finish README.md
